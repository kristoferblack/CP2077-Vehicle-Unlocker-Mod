# Vehicle Spawner Mod for Cyberpunk 2077

## What does this do?

This mod allows you spawn over 600 vehicles in the game. This includes Basilisk, AVs, Police Cars and other random things like parade floats! SPAWN THE PLANET! (Disclaimer: You can't actually spawn a planet with this mod)

Let me know if you spawn something and its invisible or otherwise broken. I've tried to go through the list and test as many vehicles as possible but due to there being so many, I couldn't test them all.

Lastly, some things you can spawn like av_heavy_cargo aren't despawnable since they don't spawn as objects in the game.

## Requirements

 - This mod requires at least version 1.10 of Cyber Engine Tweaks mod.
 - Version 1.12 of Cyberpunk 2077
